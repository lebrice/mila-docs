# Purpose of this documentation

This documentation aims to cover the information required to run scientific and data-intensive computing tasks at Mila and the available resources for its members.

It also aims to be an outlet for sharing know-how, tips and tricks and examples from the IDT team to the Mila researcher community.

## Intended audience

This documentation is mainly intended for Mila researchers having access to the Mila cluster. This access is determined by your researcher status. See the section on **Roles and authorizations** for more information. The core of the information with this purpose can be found in the section on **Computing infrastructure and policies**.

However, we also aim to provide more general information which can be useful outside the scope of using the Mila cluster. For instance, more general theory on computational considerations and such. In this perspective, we hope the documentation can be of use for all AI researchers.
